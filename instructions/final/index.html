# Final: Tutorial Site

## Summary

#### Site content:
- Written step-by-step process or tips (at least 5)
- Photos/illustrations/videos of process
- Materials you need
- Description or example of completed work
- Explanation of why you would do this tutorial (or who is this good for?)
- Tips or descriptions of what is good or bad craft for the process
